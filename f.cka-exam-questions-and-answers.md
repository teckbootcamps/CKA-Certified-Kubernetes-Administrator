### Schedule Pod on Master Node

Use context: kubectl config use-context k8s-c1-H
Create a single Pod of image httpd:2.4.41-alpine in Namespace default. The Pod should be named pod1 and the container should be named pod1-container. This Pod should only be scheduled on a master node, do not add new labels any nodes.
Shortly write the reason on why Pods are by default not scheduled on master nodes into /opt/course/2/master_schedule_reason .

First we find the master node(s) and their taints:

``` bash
k get node # find master node

k describe node cluster1-master1 | grep Taint # get master node taints

k describe node cluster1-master1 | grep Labels -A 10 # get master node labels

k get node cluster1-master1 --show-labels # OR: get master node labels
```

Next we create the Pod template:

``` bash
# check the export on the very top of this document so we can use $do
k run pod1 --image=httpd:2.4.41-alpine $do > 2.yaml

vim 2.yaml
```

Perform the necessary changes manually. Use the Kubernetes docs and search for example for tolerations and nodeSelector to find examples:


``` yaml
# 2.yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  creationTimestamp: null
  labels:
    run: pod1
  name: pod1
spec:
  containers:
  - image: httpd:2.4.41-alpine
    name: pod1-container                  # change
    resources: {}
  dnsPolicy: ClusterFirst
  restartPolicy: Always
  tolerations:                            # add
  - effect: NoSchedule                    # add
    key: node-role.kubernetes.io/master   # add
  nodeSelector:                           # add
    node-role.kubernetes.io/master: ""    # add
status: {}
```

Important here to add the toleration for running on master nodes, but also the nodeSelector to make sure it only runs on master nodes. If we only specify a toleration the Pod can be scheduled on master or worker nodes.

Now we create it:
``` bash
k -f 2.yaml create
```

Let's check if the pod is scheduled:

``` bash
➜ k get pod pod1 -o wide
NAME   READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   ...    NODE               NOMINATED NODE
pod1   1/1     Running   0          ...    cluster1-master1   <none>     

```


Finally the short reason why Pods are not scheduled on master nodes by default:

``` bash
# /opt/course/2/master_schedule_reason
master nodes usually have a taint defined
```
